# Extended-Kalman-Filter---Matlab
This repo implements the extended Kalman Filter class which is a multi-purpose EKF to facilitate the implementation and verification of EKFs in Matlab for the post-processing setting.

The user has to define the following functions, and then pass them to the class initializer in order to build an instant of the EKF class:
  1. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$[{\bf y}_{k|k-1}, {\bf \Phi}_{k-1\rightarrow k}]$">  = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$ST-MODEL(t_{k-1}, t_{k}, {\bf y}_{k-1|k-1}, {\bf P}_{k-1|k-1})$">, which is a propagation function of the state vector. The output of this function must be <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=${\bf y}_{k|k-1}$">, the predicted value of the state vector, and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=${\bf \Phi}_{k-1\rightarrow k}$"> where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=${\bf \Phi}_{k-1\rightarrow k}$"> is the state transition matrix between the two time instants <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$t_{k-1}$"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$t_{k}$">
  1. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$z_{k}$"> = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$MEAS(t_k)$"> which is a function that returns the measurement vector at time <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$t_k$">.
  1. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$[{\bf h}_k, {\bf H}_k, {\bf z}_k]$"> = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$MEAS-MODEL(t_{k}, {\bf y}_{k|k-1}, {\bf z}_k)$">: is the measurement model function. The output must be the vector <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=${\bf h}_k$"> of modeled measurements, the matrix <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=${\bf H}_k = \frac{\partial {\bf h}_k}{\partial {\bf y}_k}$">, and optionally the measrement vector after removing outlaiar measuremets.
  1. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=${\bf Q}_{k}$">, the state model covarience matrix (constant or callable), <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=${\bf Q}(t_{k}, {\bf y}_{k|k-1})$">
  1. <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=${\bf R}_{k}$">: measurement covarience matrix (constant or callable),
    <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=${\bf R}(t_{k}, {\bf z}_{k})$">

  The EKF class has some visualization cababilities, which are illustrated in the example.
